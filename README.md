# Deep Learning.ai Specialization Course Works
This repository contains my workings for [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by deeplearning.ai.

The specialization is composed of 5 courses that teaches the foundations of Deep Learning algorithms which is taught by [Dr. Andrew NG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). The specialization has a balance of theory of different algorithms and its applications to various industries. Some of the specialization's highlights are, implementation of Neural Networks from scratch, implementation of different Optimization Algorithms, how to tune a hyperparameters & evalutate it using a metric/s, initiating a Strategy for Machine Learning projects, knowing when to apply different deep learning concept, designing different Neural Network Architectures such as Convolutional Neural Network & Recurrent Neural Network, and more. Each course length ranges from 2 to 4 weeks of study, and every lecture has a Real World Problem Case Study & Programming Assignments. The programming assignments was implemented in Python, Numpy, and in Tensorflow.

##### Here is the Ascending List of the Courses:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning - [[course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)]
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization - [[course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)]
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects - [[course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)]

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

## Prerequisites
What things you need to run the notebooks and how to install them
```
python
tensorflow
numpy
```

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
